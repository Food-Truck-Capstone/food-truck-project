    <h3>Attitudes & Needs</h3>

        </ul>
        <li class="sub-tab">What Need Does This Persona Have That The Site Aims To Fill?</li>
        <ul>

        <ul>
            <li>The other platform available doesn't provide real time location data. In that application the vendor sets a schedule and location but doesn't take into account weather or a lack of customers. so if the vendor moves the customer has no way of knowing unless the vendor updates their location.</li>
